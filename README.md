# utf8string
A class to deal with UTF8 strings.
By ncluding ut8string.hpp, you can manipulate utf8 string, enabling it to:
- obtain a part of the string (substring)
- split the string with a delimiter and generate std::vector
- count the number of the letters in the string (not the byte-count length)

# utf8string
A class to deal with UTF8 strings in C++ (either std::string or C strings).
Only by including utf8string.hpp, you can manipulate utf8 string, enabling it to:
- obtain a part of the string (substring)
- split the string with a delimiter and generate std::vector
- count the number of letters in the string (not the byte-count length)
